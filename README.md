Project Title - Chariot

I created this project as my final project as a student at the Flatiron School. This is the backend portion of the application. The application allows users to set up and schedule their donations for pick up. 
Funcationalities: 
- Users can sign up and log in
- Users can schedule a date for their donations
- Users can upload a picture of their donations (link only at the moment)
- Users can choose from a list of charities for drop off 
- Users can see the shipping status of their donations and a history of their donations
